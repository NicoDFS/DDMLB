For example, if you create 5 challenges and set the limiter to 1, all five challenges will be against different users, assuming all five challenges are accepted. Conversely, if you create 5 challenges and set the limiter to unlimited, you could end up playing the same user in all five challenges, assuming one user accepted all five challenges. </p>

You can receive entry tickets by winning them in specific DraftDaily qualifier contests. Upon submitting your lineup into that ticket specific contest, your ticket will be automatically redeemed as way of entry. </p>

<p>If there is a tie at the end of the contest, users included in the tie will evenly split the related prize pool. For example, if two users tie for 1st place, and 1st place pays 20,000 and 2nd place pays 10,000 we add the combine places then split that among the tied parties. Each would receive 15,000.

    *If the prize is a ticket, the value of the ticket (or tickets) will be split.</p>
<p class="bold text-blue">What Happens If One Of My Players Is Injured/Is Out/Doesn't Play? </p>
<p>In the event that one of your players does not play, that player will receive 0 points. The player may be swapped up until the scheduled start time of his game. </p>
<p class="bold text-blue" >Are The Contests Free To Play? </p>
