            <div class="padding-md text-white">

<h4 class="margin-20">Our Commitment to Privacy</h4>
<p class="font-medium-a">Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our home page.</p>

<p class="font-medium-a margin-10px">This notice applies to all information collected from or submitted to the DraftDaily Inc. ("DraftDaily") web site and/or used in creating a DraftDaily account.</p>

<p class="font-medium-a margin-10px">This notice is incorporated into and is subject to the DraftDaily Terms of Use. Your use of our Web Site and any personal information you provide on the Web Site remains subject to the terms of this notice and the DraftDaily Terms of Use.</p>

<p class="font-medium-a margin-10px">Our Web Site may contain links to other web sites operated by third parties. DraftDaily is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of such third party web sites and this notice does not apply to those web sites.</p>
<h4 class="margin-20">Application of this Notice</h4>

<p class="font-medium-a">This notice applies only to the information collected by DraftDaily from the users of our Web Site. It does not apply to information collected by DraftDaily in any other way.</p>
<h4 class="margin-20">The Information We Collect</h4>

<p class="font-medium-a margin-10px">Our Web Site tracks certain information about the visits to our Web Site. For example, we compile statistics that show the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Web Site and its individual pages. These aggregated statistics are used internally to improve our Web Site and for product development and marketing purposes generally. Those aggregated statistics may also be provided to advertisers and other third parties, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.</p>

<p class="font-medium-a margin-10px">Our Web Site is not set up to automatically collect personally identifiable information from new visitors to our Web Site. It does recognize the home server of new visitors. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our new visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our Web Site. Once a user has visited the Web Site at least once, we may be able to match that user the next time he/she visits the Web Site. Any information previously obtained, such as an email address provided at registration, may be associated with that user but only if it were previously provided. This information will be used by DraftDaily to provide a superior user experience and relevant information and promotions.</p>

<p class="font-medium-a margin-10px">We may also request information from our users when they perform specific activities on the Web Site. For example, we request information from you when you:</p>
<br>
<p class="font-medium-a margin-10px">Log-on to certain areas of our Web Site, where you are prompted to provide us with your Username and password as a condition to gaining access to certain information, materials or services.<br>
                                        Register or sign-up to use a service.<br>
                                        Subscribe to a newsletter or desire to be added to our mailing lists for other products or services.<br>
                                        Deposit funds into your account.<br>
                                        Withdraw funds from your account.<br>
                                        Provide feedback in an online survey.<br>
                                        In each of the instances above, we typically ask for items such as your name, e-mail address, phone number, address, product preference information, DraftDaily username and password, as well as other similar personal information that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers. On occasion, we may ask for additional information to enable us to provide you with access to and use of certain information, materials and services. In the case of newsletters or mailing lists, you will be able to "unsubscribe" to these mailings at any time.</p>

<br>
										<h4 class="margin-20">How We Use Information</h4>

<p class="font-medium-a">DraftDaily only uses your personal information for specific purposes. For example, you must be at least 18 years of age, or older than 18 years of age in those jurisdictions, territories, and locations where the minimum age for permissible use of the Web Site by you is greater than 18 years old. We use such information to verify age.</p>

<p class="font-medium-a margin-10px">The personal information you provide to us when using our Web Site, such as your name, postal or e-mail address or telephone number will be kept confidential and used to support your customer relationship with DraftDaily, and to notify you of special offers, updated information and new products and services from DraftDaily, offers from third parties that we think may be of interest to you, or used by DraftDaily or third parties for the purpose of conducting market research or surveys on behalf of DraftDaily. Agents or contractors of DraftDaily who are given access to your personal information will be required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for DraftDaily.</p>

<p class="font-medium-a margin-10px">DraftDaily may enhance or merge your information collected at its Web Site with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you.</p>

<p class="font-medium-a margin-10px">With respect to network advertising companies (companies that manage and provide advertising for numerous unrelated companies), to the extent that DraftDaily utilizes such advertising companies to provide advertisements on our Web Site, DraftDaily may provide them with your log-in name and any demographic information about you that we collect. Those advertising companies may combine that data with non-personally identifiable data collected by the advertising company from your computer solely for the purpose of delivering on our Web Site advertisements that are targeted to you.</p>

<p class="font-medium-a margin-10px">Circumstances may arise where we are required to disclose your personal information to third parties for purposes other than to support your customer relationship with DraftDaily, such as in connection with a corporate divestiture or dissolution where we sell all or a portion of our business or assets (including our associated customer lists containing your personal information), or if disclosure is required by law or is pertinent to judicial or governmental investigations or proceedings.</p>

<p class="font-medium-a margin-10px">We do not share your personal information with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.</p>

<p class="font-medium-a margin-10px">You can opt out of receiving further marketing from DraftDaily at any time.</p>

<p class="font-medium-a margin-10px">We will send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. Only DraftDaily (or agents or contractors working on behalf of DraftDaily and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings. At any time you can easily opt out of receiving further marketing from DraftDaily by emailing us at support@DraftDaily.com.</p>
