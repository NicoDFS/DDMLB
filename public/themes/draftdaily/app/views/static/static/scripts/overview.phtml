									<h4 id="ovhead" class="margin-20">HOW IT WORKS</h4>
									
									<p class="font-medium-a">You’ve done most of the work! Just by clicking “Refer-A-Friend,” you are already almost earning DFSCoins. Once you’re logged into the site, there is no additional signup necessary – you will simply be assigned a unique personal link that you can give to your friends. Every time you send a referral to our site by having them click YOUR link, and they play in any one of our many daily contests you earn a share of the cost of their entry.</p>
									<br />
									
									<p class="font-medium-a">From the Refer-A-Friend page, it takes just a single click to share your unique personal link with your Facebook friends or your Twitter followers, or, if you prefer to refer a more targeted group of friends, you are one click from sending an invitation directly to their inbox. And if you have friends who you know would love playing on DraftDaily but they don’t accept your invitation right away, you can send gentle reminders with a single click. </p>
									<br />
									
									<p class="font-medium-a">Once you have started bringing in referrals, all you need to do is click on “Refer-A-Friend” to see all your important info at a single glance: </p>
									<br />
									
									<h4 id="ovhead" class="margin-20">OUR PROGRAM</h4>
									<p class="font-medium-a">With just a few clicks, you can earn up to 35% revshare.Anything that keeps your referrals coming back to the site and entering contests is helping you earn money! </p>
									<br />
									
									<p class="font-medium-a">With our great promotions and huge DFSCoin prizes, and no restrictions on the number of referrals you can bring in, the sky is the limit for what your revshares could be. But all you really need are a few active referrals and you’ll be earning DFSCoins deposited to your DraftDaily account. And since the idea is to turn that revenue into the winning entry in a big tournament, there is no telling how valuable that simple click on “Refer-A-Friend” could be.</p>
									<br />
									
									<p class="font-medium-a">Every month, you will simply see a percentage of the revenue your referrals generate deposited into your own DraftDaily account, and you can immediately start using it to enter contests. And in addition to the DFSCoins you can earn, every referral who deposits moves you one step closer to unlocking different prizes.</p>
									<br />
									
									<p class="font-medium-a"><strong>Eligibity:-</strong> Anyone who signs up is eligble, no deposit required.</p>


									<h4 class="margin-20">YOUR EARNINGS</h4>

									<p class="font-medium-a">Your earnings will come in the form of DFSCoins, valid to pay for entry into any of our contests. The revshares you earn will be credited to your account before the 15th of every month. You must earn at least 100 any pay period for payment to be processed (otherwise, any amount earned will carry forward to next pay period).</p>

										<h4 id="ovhead" class="margin-20">HOW AND WHEN WILL I GET PAID ?</h4>
										<p class="font-medium-a">Payments are made in the form of DFSCoins, deposited directly into your DraftDaily account. These deposits can be withdrawn, or can be used to pay for entry into any of our contests. The deposits will be made before the 15th of every month, but you need to have earned at least 100 in the last pay period for payment to be processed (earnings under 100 will not be lost, but will just carry forward to next pay period).</p>

										<h4 id="ovhead" class="margin-20">HOW DO YOU DETERMINE HOW MUCH I HAVE EARNED?</h4>

										<p class="font-medium-a">Every time you send a referral to our site by having them click YOUR link, and they play a deposit game, you earn a share of the cost of their entry. For 2017, you can earn 35% on every referral simply by getting us two new referrals per 30 days (if this target is not met, the share of revenue shifts to 20%).</p>


										<h4 id="ovhead" class="margin-20">HOW MUCH CAN I MAKE?</h4>
										<p class="font-medium-a margin-20">The amount you can earn depends entirely on the number of players you send our way. Please note that the income level can vary widely from one person to another. Simply put, the more you send customers our way and encourage referrals to deposit and play, the more you can earn. There is no cap on the number of players you can recruit, and therefore no limit to the amount of DFSCoins you can make.</p>
										<h4 id="ovhead" class="margin-20">HOW DO I KEEP TRACK OF HOW MUCH I HAVE EARNED?</h4>

										<p class="font-medium-a margin-20">All you have to do is use your standard DraftDaily username and password to log in to the site, and then click “Refer A Friend” right from our homepage. Once you reach the Refer A Friend page, all the information you’ll need is available at a glance. Not only can you easily send new referrals from this page, you can also easily track your performance. You will see your current rate, what you can expect in your next monthly payout, and how close you are to unlocking a prize. You can also see which referrals have signed up and which have not so you know who needs another nudge to get in on the action.
										Your lifetime performance is also recorded, and can be easily accessed through the “My Accounts” page. All of the referral income you have earned will be displayed under “Payment History.”</p>

									<p class="font-medium-a">You are entitled to participate in the Refer-A-Friend program and invite your friends and acquaintances to open an User Account.

									<h4 id="ovhead" class="margin-20">INVITATION ACTION</h4>
									<p class="font-medium-a margin-20">The Refer-A-Friend program offers several options to invite an unlimited number of your friends. All options incorporate the use of a "personal link" (unique per Player) which tracks the invitations you will be sending, as well as the performance of your invited friends. Invitation options include: E-mail where you enter up to five of your friends' first names and e-mail addresses at a time; Share where we allow you to tweet or post your personal link through social media; Promote where you copy your personal link and use it however you may wish.
