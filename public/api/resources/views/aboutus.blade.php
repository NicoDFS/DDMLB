						<h1 class="">DRAFT DAILY</h1>
						<p>We offer Daily and Weekly Fantasy Sports contests in all of the four major sports (MLB, NHL, NFL, NBA). Our 1 day leagues contests are a much shorter duration than the traditional season-long leagues and require no team management after the draft. Our salary cap draft format takes just minutes to complete, unlike the hours-long snake drafts in traditional leagues. We offer new contests every day of the season, and our winners are crowned nightly. Payouts happen immediately after the games - no more waiting until the end of the season to collect winnings!</p>
